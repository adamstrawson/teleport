// DeviceTrustService provides methods to manage, enroll and authenticate
// trusted devices.
//
// A trusted device is a device that is registered and enrolled with Teleport,
// thus allowing the system to provide some guarantees about its provenance and
// state.
//
// Managing devices requires the corresponding CRUD "device" permission.
// Additionally, creating enrollment tokens requires the "create_enroll_token"
// permission and enrolling devices requires the "enroll" permission. See
// CreateDevice, CreateDeviceEnrollToken and EnrollDevice for reference.
//
// An authenticated, trusted device allows its user to perform device-aware
// actions. Such actions include accessing an SSH node, managing sensitive
// resources via `tctl`, etc. The enforcement mode is defined via cluster-wide
// and/or per-role toggles. Device authentication is automatic for enrolled
// devices communicating with Enterprise clusters. See AuthenticateDevice for
// reference.
//
// Device Trust is a Teleport Enterprise feature. Open Source Teleport clusters
// treat all Device RPCs as unimplemented (which, in fact, they are for OSS.)
